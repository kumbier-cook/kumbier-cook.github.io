# Ingredients
* 2 bunches cilantro with stems (washed)
* 1-2 serrano peppers (with seeds)
* 1 jalapeño peppers (with seeds)
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 teaspoons rice vinegar
* 3 tablespoons mustard (see note)
* juice of 4 limes
* juice of half lemon
* juice of 1 orange
* 1/2 cups olive oil
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1/2 tablespoon salt
* 1/2 tablespoon pepper

# Directions
1. In a food processor or blender combine everything except one bunch of cilantro.

2. Blend until everything is mixed and incorporated. Taste and add additional
   peppers for heat or salt and pepper to taste

3. Add the 2nd bunch of cilantro and pulse until cilantro is chopped.  Store in
   an airtight container in the refrigerator. Can keep up to 3 weeks.

# Notes & tips

1. This recipe varies quite a bit depending on the mustard you use. I prefer a
   mustard that is slightly sweet and spicy — Bone Suckin' Mustard is my go to
if you can find it!

I originally discovered this sauce at Cheeseboard, a local pizza shop. The
recipe here is cobbled together from various places across the internet along
with my own tweaks to get the flavor I prefer.
