# Directions

### Poached chicken

1. Combine chicken stock, chicken parts, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme,
   parsley, rosemary, and bay leaf in a 5-quart stainless steel pot or saucier.
Cover and place over medium-high heat until stock registers about 150°F (66°C)
on a digital thermometer.

2. Adjust heat to maintain that temperature, plus or minus 10°F, and cook until
   thickest part of chicken registers 135°F (57°C), about 1 hour. Remove chicken
with tongs, set aside on a rimmed platter, and cover loosely. Strain stock
through a mesh sieve into a large bowl, discard solids, and set stock aside to
cool.

### Filling

3. Combine gelatin and 1/4 cup (55ml) cooled stock in a small bowl and whisk
   until no lumps remain; set aside. In a 5-quart saucier, melt butter over
medium-low heat, then whisk in flour. Stir with a heat-resistant spatula until
roux is fragrant and a nutty blond color, about 5 minutes (it's okay to adjust
the heat if this seems to be happening too slowly). Stir in diced onion,
carrots, and celery and continue cooking and stirring until vegetables are
slightly softened, about 7 minutes more.

4. Add white wine and 1 quart reserved stock, stirring constantly until smooth;
   remaining stock from poaching can be reserved for another use. Increase heat
to medium-high and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Once it begins to
bubble, remove from heat. Stir in frozen peas, diced pimentos, and prepared
gelatin, followed by salt, thyme, rosemary, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.
Stir until gelatin has fully melted into sauce and adjust seasonings to taste.

5. Shred or dice reserved chicken, discarding skin and bones, then stir into
   filling. If it better suits your schedule, the filling can be covered and
refrigerated up to 3 days, or frozen in an airtight container for 3 months.
Otherwise, divide filling between 6 individual oven-safe dishes, or add to a
2-quart glass or ceramic baking dish (approximately 7 by 11 inches). Place on a
foil- or parchment-lined baking sheet and set aside.

### Assembly

6. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). With a
   sharp knife, cut chilled dough into 6 roughly equal pieces. Roll out one
sheet and place in pie dish. 

7. Pour filling into pie dish dish. Roll out reminaing dough and cover the pie.
Gently crimp the edges with a fork to seal pastry to bottom crust.

8. For the Egg Wash (if using): Whisk egg, cream, and salt in a small bowl.
   Brush over top crust of each pie in a thin, even layer. This will give the
crust a glossy golden sheen.

9. Transfer dishes to a foil- or parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until
   pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbling-hot, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving, to allow the filling to thicken and
reach a safe temperature to enjoy. Covered in foil, leftovers can be
refrigerated up to 3 days and reheated to serve.
