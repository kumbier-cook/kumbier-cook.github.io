# Ingredients

### Dough:

* 300g bread flour (10.5 ounces; about 2 generous cups)
* 5g instant yeast (0.15 ounce; about 1 teaspoon), such as SAF Instant Yeast
* 9g salt (0.3 ounce; about 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt or 1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt)
* 220g water (7.75 ounces; about 1 cup minus 1 1/2 teaspoons)
* Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed

### Sauce:

* 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil
* 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 2 teaspoons (about 5g) dried oregano
* Dash red pepper flakes
* 1 (28-ounce; 800g) can high-quality crushed tomatoes
* 1 teaspoon (about 6g) granulated garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon (about 6g) granulated onion powder
* 1 tablespoon (about 15g) sugar
* Kosher salt, to taste

### Finish:

* 12 ounces (340g) cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (see note)
* Toppings (see note)

# Directions

1. Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a
   dough hook attachment. Stir to combine, then add water. Mix on low speed
until dough comes together into a rough ball, then shut off mixer and let rest
for 10 minutes. Continue mixing at medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth,
silky ball, about 10 minutes longer. (It should stick to the bottom of the bowl
as it kneads rather than riding around the edges.) Remove dough hook, form dough
into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl, cover tightly with
plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in
volume, about 2 hours.

2. Pour a couple tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a Detroit-style anodized
   aluminum pan or two 8- by 8-inch cake pans. (Split dough in half if using
cake pans.) Transfer dough to pan(s) and turn to coat in oil. Press down on
dough and spread it toward the edges. You won't be able to get it all the way to
the edges; this is okay. Spread it as much as you can without tearing, then
cover tightly in plastic and set aside for 30 minutes to allow dough to relax.
Return to dough and stretch it out again. It should be able to reach the edges
this time. If not, let it rest a little more and try again. To get the dough to
stay in the corners, stretch it up beyond the corners so that it pulls back into
place. Once dough is stretched, cover again and set aside while you make the
sauce.

3. For the Sauce: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 550°F
   (290°C), or as close to it as your oven gets. Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive
oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic,
oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook
until reduced to about 3 cups, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt.

4. To Form the Pizza: Press down on dough with your fingertips to remove any
   large air bubbles. Lay half of pepperoni (if using) evenly over face of
dough. Top with cheese, spreading it evenly all the way to the very edges of the
pan, then add remaining pepperoni. Spoon sauce over surface in 3 even rows. (You
will need only about half the sauce—save the rest for another pizza.)

5. Transfer to oven and bake until edges are black and bubbly and exposed cheese
   on top is starting to lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a trivet
or folded kitchen towel on countertop.

6. Run a thin metal spatula all the way around the edges of the pan to loosen
   the pizza. Carefully lift it out and slide it onto a cutting board. Cut pizza
and serve.

# Notes & tips

1. The original recipe calls for brick cheese. I've had trouble finding this and
   use a combination of low-moisture mozzarella, mild cheddar, parmesean, and
asiago. 

2. My preferred toppings are caramelized onion and mushroom.

2. For best results, use a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan. If you can't get
   your hands on that kind of pan, you can split the recipe into two square 8-
by 8-inch cake pans.
