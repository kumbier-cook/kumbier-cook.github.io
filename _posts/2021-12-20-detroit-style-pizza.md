# Ingredients

### Dough:

* 255g bread flour
* 2g instant yeast
* 7g salt
* 206g water 
* 85g sourdough starter
* Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed

### Sauce:

* 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil
* 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 2 teaspoons (about 5g) dried oregano
* Dash red pepper flakes
* 1 (28-ounce; 800g) can high-quality crushed tomatoes
* 1 teaspoon (about 6g) granulated garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon (about 6g) granulated onion powder
* 1 tablespoon (about 15g) sugar
* Kosher salt, to taste

### Finish:

* 12 ounces (340g) cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (see note)
* Toppings (see note)

# Directions

1. Combine flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl. Perform 4-5 sets of stretch and
folds spaced apart by 5 minutes. Cover and place in the refrigerator overnight.
Pull out ~1 hour before you want to start panning the dough to warm. 

2. Pour a couple tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a Detroit-style anodized
   aluminum pan or two 8- by 8-inch cake pans. (Split dough in half if using
cake pans.) Transfer dough to pan(s) and turn to coat in oil. Press down on
dough and spread it toward the edges. You won't be able to get it all the way to
the edges; this is okay. Spread it as much as you can without tearing, then
cover tightly in plastic and set aside for 30 minutes to allow dough to relax.
Return to dough and stretch it out again. It should be able to reach the edges
this time. If not, let it rest a little more and try again. To get the dough to
stay in the corners, stretch it up beyond the corners so that it pulls back into
place. Dimple the dough by prodding with your fingers. Once dough is stretched, cover 
again and set aside while you make the sauce.

3. For the Sauce: Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 550°F
   (290°C), or as close to it as your oven gets. Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive
oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic,
oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook
until reduced to about 3 cups, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt.

4. To Form the Pizza: Press down on dough with your fingertips to remove any
large air bubbles. Top with cheese, spreading it evenly all the way to the very
edges of the pan. Spoon sauce over surface in 3 even rows. (You will need only
about half the sauce—save the rest for another pizza.)

5. Transfer to oven and bake until edges are black and bubbly and exposed cheese
   on top is starting to lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a trivet
or folded kitchen towel on countertop.

6. Run a thin metal spatula all the way around the edges of the pan to loosen
   the pizza. Carefully lift it out and slide it onto a cutting board. Cut pizza
and serve.

# Notes & tips

1. The original recipe calls for brick cheese. I've had trouble finding this and
use a combination of low-moisture mozzarella, mild cheddar, parmesean, and
asiago. 

2. My preferred toppings are caramelized onion and mushroom.

3. For best results, use a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan. If you can't get
your hands on that kind of pan, you can split the recipe into two square 8-
by 8-inch cake pans.

4. I find ~2x 28oz cans of sauce will be enough for 3 pizzas.

The original recipe is taken from [serious
eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/detroit-style-pizza-recipe), but dough and
prep have been modified to make the pizza I prefer.
