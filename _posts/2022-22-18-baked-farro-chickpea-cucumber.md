# Ingredients
* 3 cups cooked farro or a mix, shaken or patted dry
* 8 to 9 ounces halloumi or feta, torn into ½- to 1-inch pieces (see note)
* 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained, rinsed and shaken dry
* 4 Persian or mini seedless cucumbers
* 1 lb. tomatoes, chopped (optiona)
* Kosher salt
* 2 limes or lemons or 1 grapefruit
* 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro, dill or parsley leaves and stems, or a mix
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin or coriander
* Black pepper

# Directions
1. Heat the broiler on high with a rack six or fewer inches from the heat
   source. Put the grains, halloumi and chickpeas on a sheet pan to air dry
while you prepare the other ingredients. (You can do this up to a day ahead and
refrigerate the sheet pan.)

2. Meanwhile, smash the cucumbers with the side of your knife until they’re
   craggy and split. Coarsely chop into irregular ½-inch pieces. Transfer the
cucumbers and any liquid on the cutting board to a small bowl and season with
salt. Finely grate about 1 teaspoon of the citrus zest over the cucumbers, then
squeeze in 3 tablespoons juice. Cut any remaining citrus into wedges for
serving. Add the herbs and 1 tablespoon olive oil, stir to combine and set
aside. (Cucumbers can be prepared up to 3 hours in advance.)

3. Add remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and the cumin to the sheet pan. Stir to
   combine. Season with salt and pepper, spread in an even layer, and broil,
shaking the pan occasionally or tossing with a fork, until the chickpeas start
to pop and everything is crisped and golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes.

4. Serve the grain-bean mixture topped with the cucumbers and the dressing in
   the bowl. Season to taste with salt, pepper, citrus juice and olive oil.

# Notes & tips

1. fetta gives better flavor but halloumi better texture.
