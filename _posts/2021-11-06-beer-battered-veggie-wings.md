# Ingredients

* 1 head cauliflower
* 1 cup beer
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 6 cups vegetable or canola oil

# Directions

1. Rinse cauliflower and remove greens. Chop into medium sized
   chunks, roughly the size of a golf ball (see note), and set aside.
2. In a large mixing bowl, mix beer and flour until no clumps remain. Add
   cauliflower and stir until pieces are completely coated.
3. In a large pot, heat 4 cups of oil over medium high heat. When oil reaches 400°F, add
   ~1/4 of the beer battered cauliflower (see note). Cook until golden brown,
about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking to the bottom of the
pot. As pieces finish, scoop out with a slotted spoon and place on
wire rack.  
4. Working in batches, fry the remaining cauliflower. Before starting a new
   batch, check that you haven't lost too much oil and that the temperature is
still near 400°F. If necessary, add oil and/or adjust the burner to maintain
temperature (see note).  
5. Cover with your choice of sauce/toppings and serve immediately (see note)

# Notes & tips

1. The size of the cauliflower makes a big difference. Too big and the wings end
   up overly soggy. Too small and the wings end up overly crunchy. Try
experimenting with the size to find what you like!
2. The temperature will drop when you add cauliflower. Check the oil
   tempertature before each round of frying to ensure the batter crisps up
nicely!
3. You will lose oil with each round of frying. Make sure to top oil of (for ~4
   cups). Maintaining oil levels ensures that the temperature doesn't drop too
much when you add a new batch of wings — giving you the nice crispy batter!
4. I prefer these wings with [chili lime sauce]({% post_url
   2021-11-06-chili-lime-sauce %}), cilantro, and sesame seeds. Don't add sauce
to any wings you want to save as leftovers as they will get soggy. Leftovers can
be re-fried or baked.
