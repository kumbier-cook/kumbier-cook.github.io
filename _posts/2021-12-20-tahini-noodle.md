# Ingredients
* 1 cup tahini
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Juice from 1 lemon
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* Salt & pepper, to taste
* 1 pound pasta noodles (see note)

# Directions
1. In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil on medium heat until shimmering. Add
   garlic and cook until golden brown. Turn off heat. Add tahini, cumin, and
lemon juice. The sauce will look slightly chunky at this point. Gradually add
cool water, stirring constantly, until smooth, about 1/2-1 cup.

2. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook noodles and cover
   in tahini sauce.

# Notes & tips
1. I prefer this recipe with thick cut, homemade wheat noodles.

2. This recipe is great on its own or with a variety of roasted veggies and/or
   flank steak.
