# Ingredients
* 3 quarts canola oil
* 4 pounds chicken wings, cut into drumettes and flats
* Sauce (see note)

# Directions
1. Place oil and chicken wings in a large wok or Dutch oven. Heat over
   medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until it registers 225 to 250째F on
an instant-read or deep-fry thermometer (chicken should be gently bubbling).
Continue to cook, stirring and flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting
heat to maintain a temperature of 225 to 250째F until chicken is cooked through
and skin is tender but not crisp or browned, about 20 minutes total. Transfer
chicken with a wire mesh spider to a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper
towels. Allow chicken to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or cover
and rest in the fridge for up to three nights.

2. Heat oil to 400째F. Carefully add one third of chicken and cook, stirring and
   flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature
of 375 to 400째F until golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes total. Transfer
to bowl with sauce, toss to coat, and serve with blue cheese dressing and
celery. Repeat with remaining batches, serving one batch at a time.
