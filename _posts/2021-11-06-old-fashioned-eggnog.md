# Ingredients

* 1 dozen eggs
* 1 pint whipping cream
* 1 quart half & half
* 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
* 2 Tbsp vanilla extract

# Directions

1. Separate egg yolks and whites into two large bowls.

2. Beat yolks until no separation remains and frothy on top.

3. Clean beater heads and beat whites until frothy and somewhat white but still
   bubbly.

4. Using a flat, wide spatula, carefully scoop foam from beaten whites into bowl
   of yolks, leavning unbeaten whites in the bowl. 

5. Repeat until all whites have been added to yolks.

6. Beat combined yolks and whites thoroughly until blended.

7. With beater running, slowly add cream and half & half. Add sugar slowly,
   tasting for sweetness. Add vanilla slowly, tasting for flavor.

This recipe comes from my grandpa (Joe Weinburger). There's a long story for
