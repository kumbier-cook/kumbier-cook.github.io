# Ingredients

### Filling
* 20 ounces fresh blueberries (3 1/4 cups; 565g)
* 8 ounces wild blueberries (2 cups; 225g), fresh or frozen (see note)
* 1 ounce fresh juice from 1 orange (2 tablespoons; 30g)
* 1 ounce orange zest
* 7 ounces sugar (1 cup; 195g)
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
* 1 1/2 ounces tapioca starch (1/3 cup plus 1 teaspoon; 40g), such as Bob's Red Mill (see note)

### Crust
* [Pie Dough]({% post_url 2021-10-09-pie-crust %}), rolled and chilled.

### Egg Wash (optional):
* 1 large egg
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/2 ounce heavy cream (1 tablespoon; 15g)
* 1/8 teaspoon (0.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight

# Directions

1. **For the Filling:** Toss regular and wild blueberries, orange juice, sugar, salt,
   vanilla, and tapioca starch in a large bowl, folding with a
flexible spatula until well combined. Scrape into prepared pie shell and top
with remaining dough, using a solid sheet, cutouts, or a lattice-top design.
(Check out my tutorial here.) Trim away excess dough and refrigerate to ensure
top crust is completely chilled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack
to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C).

2. **For the Egg Wash (if using):** Whisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a
   small bowl. Brush over chilled top crust in a thin, even layer. This will
give the crust a glossy, golden sheen, but it is not necessary in any way.

3. Place chilled pie on a parchment-lined half-sheet pan. Bake until crust is
golden, about 1 hour, then loosely cover with tented foil. (Alternatively, an
empty baking sheet can be placed on the topmost rack of the oven to serve as a
shield.) Continue baking until filling is bubbling even in the very center of
the pie, about 15 minutes longer. If crust completely covers filling, bake until
pie reaches an internal temperature of 213°F (101°C) on a digital thermometer.
The time can vary considerably depending on the thickness and type of pie plate,
the amount of top crust, how long the pie was refrigerated, et cetera.

4. To Serve: Cool pie until no warmer than 85°F (29°C) on a digital thermometer,
   about 3 hours depending on the type of pie plate (at higher temperatures,
filling will be runny and thin). Slice into wedges with a sharp knife, pressing
firmly against bottom and sides of pie plate to ensure the bottom crust is
completely cut. If you like, serve with Lemon Chantilly. Wrapped in foil,
leftovers will keep up to 3 days at room temperature; warm 10 minutes in a 350°F
(180°C) oven to revive crust before serving.
