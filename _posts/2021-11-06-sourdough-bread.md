# Ingredients
- 822g	Medium-protein bread flour
- 64g	Whole wheat flour
- 650g	Water
- 17g	Fine sea salt
- 151g	Ripe liquid levain (see above)

# Directions
Add ingredients to mixing bowl that underwent. Add the water slowly, in stages,
while you're mixing, and stop adding water if the dough feels excessively wet or
soupy at any point.

Perform folds for about 2-3 minutes in the bowl. Grab under one side, pull up
and over to the other side, then rotate the bowl a bit and repeat. I do this
probably 30 times or so (it goes fast and easy). In the end, the dough should
still be shaggy, but it will be more smooth and will start to hold itself
together more in the bowl.

I find that the correct level of dough strength at this point is important. You
want the dough to be smooth, elastic, and strong, but it doesn't have to be
fully developed, and it will still be shaggy. We will continue to strengthen the
dough through stretch and folds in bulk fermentation.

Transfer dough to a tub or thick-walled bowl for bulk fermentation.

## Bulk fermentation, 4h
At 78°F (25°C) ambient temperature, bulk fermentation should go for about 4
hours. Perform six sets of stretch and folds during the bulk. The first three
are at 15-minute intervals, and the last three are at 30-minute intervals. After
these folds (2 hours and 15 minutes have gone by), let the dough rest for the
remainder of bulk fermentation.


I stretch and fold more vigorously at the beginning of bulk than usual since it
is extraordinarily slack and extensible (due to this recipe's high hydration and
autolyse). Pick up one side of the dough with both hands and pull it up, just
before tearing, and fold it over to the other side. Rotate your container and
repeat 4 or 5 times. That is one set.

It is essential that the dough is kept near 78°F (25°C) as much as possible
(minor fluctuations up and down are ok). If temperatures dip down too far, you
might have to extend the bulk fermentation duration to compensate, and vice
versa. Use your judgment, the signs described below, and be flexible.

At the end of bulk, your dough should look very gassy, with some bubbles here
and there, and the edges where the dough meets the bowl should be slightly
domed. You can see all these signs in the image above.

When you gently shake the bowl, the entire mass jiggles from side to side—very
alive. You'll also notice that compared with the photo at the beginning of bulk,
the dough is smoother and holds its edges, folds, and creases more readily (most
of the bumps and ridges you see are due to trapped gasses from fermentation).
