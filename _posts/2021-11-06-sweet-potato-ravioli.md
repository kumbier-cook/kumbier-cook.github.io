# Ingredients

* 16 oz fresh pasta dough
* 2 medium sweet potatoes 
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic
* 4 Tbsp butter
* 1 cup ricotta
* Salt and pepper to taste

# Directions

### Filling
1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Poke holes in sweet potatoes with fork; wrap each
   potato in foil along with half of the butter, garlic, and onions. Place
wrapped sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and bake until soft, about 1 hour.

2. Scoop sweet potatoes, onions, and garlic in blender or food processor,
   scraping in as much melted butter as possible, along with ricotta. Blend
until smooth. Salt and pepper to taste.

### Ravioli
1. Working in batches, roll out pasta dough into 2, 10" x 4" sheets. If using a
   pasta roller, set thickness to 6.

2. Place one sheet on lightly floured surface and scoop out 2 x 4 grid of
   filling, ~1 tablesppon each.

3. Place the second sheet on top of the first. Using fingertips, firmly seal
   dough, starting next top the filling and working outwards. The goal here is
to eliminate as many air pockets/bubbles as possible. Cut into squares.

4. Repeat with the remaining dough/filling.

5. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add ravioli; cook
   until ravioli float to top, about 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cool water.

6. Cover with desired sauce (see note) and serve.

# Notes & tips
1. I like this recipe with [pesto]({% post_url 2021-12-20-pesto %}), pine nuts,
   and sauteed kale. It also goes well with a browned butter sage sauce and
parmesean cheese.
