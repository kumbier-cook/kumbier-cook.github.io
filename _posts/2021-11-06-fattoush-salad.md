# Ingredients

### Salad
* 1 head Romaine lettuce
* 1 purple onion, diced
* 1 tomato, chopped
* 1 cucumber
* 3 pieces pita bread
* 1 bunch mint leaves, chopped
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* salt to taste

### Dressing
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
* 1 teaspoon honey
* 1 teaspoon sumac
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* salt and pepper to taste

# Directions
1. Mix together olive oil, vinegar, honey, sumac, garlic powder, cumin, salt,
   and pepper for dressing. Set aside.

2. Chop each piece of pita bread into 8 wedges. In a large pan, heat 1/4 cup of
   olive oil on medium until shimmering. Add 1/3 of the pita bread and fry until
golden brown and crisp, turing frequently and adjusting heat to prevent burning;
about 6 minutes. Repeat with the remaining two batches, adding oil as necessary. 

3. Place the fried pita bread in a medium bowl. Sprinkle with garlic powder and
   salt and mix.

4. Skin cucumber, remove core, and chop. Mix with lettuce, onion, tomato,
   mint, and fired pita. Toss salad in dressing and serve.
