# Ingredients
* 2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
* 4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
* 1 large poblano pepper, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
* 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, finely chopped, plus 1 teaspoon sauce
* 3/4 cup roasted cashews
* 1/2 cup finely crumbled feta or cotija cheese
* 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
* 1 large egg
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Cheese for topping, such as pepper jack, cheddar, or blue
* 6 to 8 hearty hamburger buns, toasted
* Condiments as desired, such as chipotle mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise
* Toppings as desired, such as shredded lettuce, mushrooms, carmelized onions

# Directions
1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread
   black beans in a single layer on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Roast
until beans are mostly split open and outer skins are beginning to get crunchy,
about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.

2. While beans roast, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over
   medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and poblano and cook, stirring
frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring
constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chipotle chile and sauce and
cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to a large
bowl.  

3. Place cashews in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until chopped into
   pieces no larger than 1/3-inch, about 12 short pulses. Add to bowl with
onions and peppers.

4. When beans are slightly cooled, transfer to food processor. Add cheese. Pulse
   until beans are roughly chopped (the largest pieces should be about 1/3 of a
full bean in size). Transfer to bowl with onion/pepper mixture. Add bread
crumbs, egg, and mayonnaise and season with salt and pepper. Fold together
gently but thoroughly with hands. Patty mixture can be stored in an airtight
container in the refrigerator for up to three days at this stage.

5. To cook: Form bean mixture into 6 to 8 patties as wide as your burger buns.
   Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium
heat until shimmering. Add 4 patties and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until
well browned and crisp on first side, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook
until second side is browned, about 5 minutes longer, adding cheese if desired.
If cooking more than 4 burgers, cook in batches, keeping cooked burgers on a
rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a 200°F oven while second batch cooks.

# Notes & tips
Patty mixture can be made through step 4 and stored in a sealed container in the
refrigerator for up to 3 days before forming patties and cooking as desired. To
freeze, place formed patties on a parchment-lined baking sheet and place in
freezer until fully frozen, about 1 hour. Remove from freezer and cut parchment
around each burger. Stack frozen burgers with the parchment in between each
layer. Transfer to a zipper-lock freezer bag and freeze for up to 3 months. To
cook frozen burgers, break apart and spread in a single layer on a baking sheet
or cutting board and allow to thaw at room temperature for 1 hour before cooking
as directed.
