# Ingredients

### Dough

* 477g	All-purpose or bread flour (King Arthur All-Purpose Flour)

* 191g	Unsalted butter (Kerrygold)
* 191g	Whole eggs (about 4 large)

* 11g	Salt
* 200g	Ripe, 100% hydration liquid sourdough starter

### Brown sugar cinnamon

* 215g light brown sugar
* 40g all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Cream cheese glaze

* 114g cream cheese softened to room temp (4 oz, half a standard block)
* 62g (1/2 cup) powdered sugar
* 37g (3 tablespoons) whole milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

# Directions

### Dough
##### 1. Mix
First, take out the butter and cut it into 1/4” to 1/2” squares; let them sit in
a bowl to warm to room temperature while gathering and mixing other ingredients.  

*Initial Incorporation*
In a medium bowl add the cold eggs, cold whole milk, sugar, and mature sourdough
starter. Whisk together until incorporated.

Add the flour and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook
attachment. Set the mixer to low (level “1” on my machine, one notch above
“STIR”), and slowly start to pour the liquid into the mixer bowl. Add a little
at a time over the course of 3 minutes. Once finished the dough will look very
wet and have clumps, let it rest for 10 minutes before further strengthening.

*Strengthen Dough*
After the 10 minute rest, turn the mixer to medium speed (number “4” on my
machine) and mix for about 5-6 minutes until the dough starts to come together
and all clumps have disappeared. The dough should start to pull from the bowl's
sides, but it will not completely remove from the bottom. If the dough doesn’t
want to come together and it’s overly wet, add a little flour, a tablespoon at a
time, until it comes together.  

*Incorporate Butter*
Butter temperature is important. It should be slightly cold to the touch but
easily pliable. If the butter is too cold, it won’t incorporate easily into the
dough; if it’s too warm (almost melting), it will make for a greasy dough. Don’t
fret if the temperature is off. Pop the bowl with butter in the microwave for 10
seconds to warm slowly, or place it into the freezer for a minute or two to firm
up. Adjust as necessary.

Add the butter to the dough one square at a time, waiting until the previous
block is absorbed before adding the next. It incorporates easiest if placed
right where the hook meets the dough. Continue until all the butter is added and
there are no butter patches visible; this could take 8-10 minutes at low/medium
mix speed.

##### 2. Bulk Fermentation 
Transfer the mixed dough to a bulk container and let ferment for 2 hours at 75ºF
(23°C). Just like when baking sourdough bread, do 3 to 4 sets of stretch and
folds during bulk spaced out by 30 minutes. If the dough is firm after the third
set, skip the last set but let the dough rest for a full 2 hours.  

##### 3. Chill 
Place the covered bulk container into the fridge for at least 2 hours (I like
3-4 hours). The timing at this point is very flexible. Once the dough is covered
and in the fridge, it can rest there overnight and the rest of the process can
be done in the morning for fresh rolls early or for brunch. The dough does need
to be completely cold and firm to the touch before rolling out, do not shortcut
this step.

##### 4. Shape Rolls
Before rolling out the dough make the Brown Sugar Cinnamon mixture (see recipe,
above).

Flour your work surface. Then, remove the chilled dough from the fridge and turn
it out to the floured surface. Flour the top of the dough and the rolling pin
and begin rolling the dough. Roll it out to an 11” x 21” rectangle that is
oriented so one of the long sides is near your body and the squat ends are to
the sides. Use a bench knife and a dusting of flour anywhere the dough sticks to
the surface.

Try to keep your warm hands off the dough as much as possible to avoid heating
it. Sprinkle the dry Brown Sugar Cinnamon mixture evenly over the dough but
leave a small margin at the very top bare. When the dough is rolled up, that
small margin will help seal the roll.

Starting at the long end nearest you, fold up a small portion of the dough all
the way across, then roll one revolution at a time starting at the left side of
the dough moving to the right. During the first few rolls, it’s important to
roll things up sufficiently tight to make cutting and transferring easier later.

Continue rolling from left to right, one revolution at a time, until the dough
is completely rolled up into a “log.” Layout a ruler and using a sharp knife or
bench scraper cut the dough every 1 3/4” inches. You can go smaller if you want
squatter rolls or up to 2” for taller rolls (if you cut smaller you’ll have more
rolls and taller you’ll have less).

Transfer the cut discs to a baking pan with some space around each one.

A few tips to help with this step:

* Place the rolling pin in the freezer while the dough is chilling to help keep
  it cold. 

* If the dough warms up excessively while rolling out, transfer to a baking
  sheet and place in the fridge for 15 minutes to cool. 

* If the dough is very pliable and warm after it’s completely rolled up, place
  the entire rolled “log” into the fridge on a baking sheet before cutting.

##### 5. Proof
Place the baking pan with cut dough somewhere warm, around 77°F (25°C), to let
proof for 2 hours. During proof, the rolls will relax out and start to puff up,
eventually, they may touch each other but it depends on how much space you have
between rolls.

Don’t be alarmed if you see any sugary liquid leaking out of the rolls, it’s
totally normal. Additionally, if any of the layers develop gaps between them it
only means when they rise in the oven they'll be a little more interesting with
pieces jutting up and out—beautiful.

##### 6. Bake
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) during the last 30 minutes of proof. Place the
baking pan in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes until the rolls are well
colored.

Spread the glaze over the rolls once cooled. These sourdough cinnamon rolls stay
great for a few days in the fridge, and I always reheat them (without glaze) in
the oven or microwave to warm back up before eating. They fill the kitchen with
that intoxicating aroma once again and always seem to come out as if they were
freshly baked.

### Brown sugar cinnamon

Mix or whisk everything together in a bowl so there are few clumps remaining.
Keep covered until used (brown sugar dries out very fast).

### Cream cheese glaze

Add everything to a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk until
creamy and soft. It’s best and easiest to use a mixer or handheld beater for
this, but a handheld whisk will work if you want a workout. The mixer will
ensure there are no stray clumps of cream cheese lingering about.
