# Ingredients
* 1 (1-pound) loaf sourdough bread 10 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 pound turkey sausage, casing removed
* 2 cups diced onions
* 1/2 sprig rosemary
* 2 teaspoons thyme leaves
* 2 sliced chile de arbol
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
* Black pepper, to taste
* 1 pound lacinato kale (also known as Tuscan kale), about 2 large or 3 small bunches, tough rib stems removed and roughly chopped
* 3 ounces deglet noor dates (about 16), cut in half length wise
* 1 cup dry sherry
* 2 cups chicken or turkey stock 4 tablespoons unsalted butter cup roughly chopped toasted almonds

# Directions

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Cut the crust off the bread and tear remaining loaf
   into 1-inch croutons. Place torn bread on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle
with 4 tablespoons olive oil, squeezing and tossing bread with your hands to
help it absorb the oil. Transfer to oven and toast, tossing once or twice, until
croutons are golden brown and crispy on the outside but still a little soft and
tender inside, 12 to 15 minutes. When croutons have cooled, place them in a
large bowl.  

2. Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive
   oil and crumble sausage into pan. Saut√©, breaking up sausage with a wooden
spoon, until browned and just cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer sausage
to the bowl with the croutons using a slotted spoon.

3. Return the pot to medium heat and add 2 more tablespoons olive oil, the
   onions, the rosemary sprig, the thyme and the chile. Season with 1/2 teaspoon
salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Continue cooking another 3 to 4 minutes,
stirring often, until onion is soft and starting to color slightly.

4. Add half the kale and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the pan. Use
   tongs to turn the greens to coat them in oil and help them wilt and cook
down. When there is room in the pan (from the greens wilting), add the rest of
the kale and season with another 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.
As soon as all the kale has wilted, transfer mixture to the bowl with the
croutons and sausage. Remove rosemary. Add dates and stir well to combine.

5. Return pot to stove over high heat and carefully pour in sherry. Boil until
   sherry is reduced by three-quarters, then add stock. Boil until mixture is
reduced by half, then swirl in butter until melted.  

6. Pour hot liquid over crouton-kale mixture. Add almonds and toss well to
   combine; using tongs or your hands, squeeze and massage the stuffing to
integrate the flavors and make sure bread has really soaked in all the liquid.

7. Transfer stuffing to a ceramic baking dish or casserole. Cover and bake 15
minutes in the 400-degree oven. Uncover and bake 10 to 15 more minutes, or until
top is golden and crisp.
