# Ingredients
* 5 tablespoons dark brown sugar (2 1/4 ounces; 65g)
* 1 tablespoon (about 9g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight
* 1 tablespoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1/2 teaspoon ground fennel seed
* Large pinch cayenne pepper
* 1 whole bone-in or boneless pork butt (5 to 7 pounds; 2.25 to 3kg)
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 large onion, finely minced (about 6 ounces; 170g)
* 1 cup (240ml) beer

# Directions

1. Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 200Â°F. Combine
   sugar, salt, paprika, cumin, black pepper, coriander, ground fennel seed,
chili powder, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl and mix. Season pork with 3
tablespoons of spice mixture, making sure to rub it on all sides.

2. Heat butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork
   and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 5
minutes total. (Pork will brown fast because of the sugar. Do not let it burn.)
Add onion and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the
pan, until softened, about 2 minutes.

3. Make sure pork is oriented fat side up. Add beer. Cover Dutch oven, transfer
   to oven, and cook until pork is just starting to turn tender, about 6-8
hours.  Remove lid and continue cooking until a knife or fork shows very little
resistance when twisted inside the meat and a dark bark has formed, about 1 hour
longer.  

4. Transfer pork to a large bowl, reserving liquid in pot. Using a ladle, skim off
excess fat and discard. Add reserved sauce and remaining vinegar to pot and
whisk to combine. When pork is cool enough to handle, shred with two forks.

5. Transfer shredded pork to pot and serve with [barbecue sauce]({% post_url
