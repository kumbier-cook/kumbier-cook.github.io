# Ingredients

- 2 large ancho peppers
- 3 large guajillo peppers
- 5-6 chile de arbol peppers
- 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds
- 6 garlic cloves while
- 1 shallot, sliced
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 3/4 cups olive oil or use vegetable oil
- juice from 1/2 orange
- Orange zest
- 1 Tbsp honey
- juice from 1 lime
- Salt to taste I use 1/2 teaspoon
- 1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano

# Directions

1. Remove the stems and seeds from the anchos, guajillos and chiles de arbol.
   Chop or cut them into very small pieces, about 1/4 inch or smaller. Set them
aside.

2. Add the peanuts, garlic, sesame seeds and oil in a medium pot. Heat to
   medium-high heat and cook for 5 minutes, or until the garlic starts to to
crisp up and the seeds turn golden brown.

3. Remove from heat and stir in the chili pepper bits. Allow to cool for 10
   minutes.

4. Stir in the vinegar, salt and Mexican oregano.

5. Pour the mixture into a blender or food processor and pulse several times
   until the salsa is nicely combined. Don't over-process the salsa macha, as
you want to have nice crispy bits, not a puree. Serve or refrigerate!
