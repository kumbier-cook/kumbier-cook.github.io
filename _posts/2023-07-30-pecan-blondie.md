## Praline
* Unsalted butter, 2 Tbsp
* Pecan pieces, 1 cup (115g)
* Sea salt, 1⁄2 tsp
* Vanilla extract, 1⁄2 tsp
* Water, 2 Tbsp (27g)
* Granulated sugar, 1⁄2 cup plus 1 Tbsp (115 g)

## Blondies
* Muscovado brown sugar, 1 cup plus 3 Tbsp packed (230g)
* Unsalted butter, melted 1cup (230g)
* Large eggs, 2 
* Vanilla extract, 1 tsp
* All-purpose flour, 1 1/2 cup (200g) 
* Sea salt 1/2 tsp
* Baking powder 1 tsp

# Directions

## Praline
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F[165°C]. Spray a 9-by-9-in [23-by-23-cm] square
   baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.

2. Brown the butter as follows: Place the butter in a medium saucepan over
   medium heat. It will melt and then begin to sizzle-this is the water cooking
out. Once it stops sizzling, the milk solids in the butter will begin to brown.
Swirl the pan often, and remove it from the heat when it smells nutty andthere
aregolden brown speckles in the pan. Err on the side of browning too little,
because the butter will continuet o cook in the pan after you remove it from the
heat. Add the pecan pieces, salt, and vanilla extract to the browned butter and 
toss to coat the nuts.

3. Toast the pecans on a sheet tray at 325°F [165°C] for 12 minutes until they
   are toasty brown. Start checking after 8 minutes. Set aside. Leave the oven
set at 325°F [165°C] to bake the blondies.Line baking sheet with parchment paper
or silicone mat.

4. Next, caramelize the sugar: Stir together the water and sugar in a small
   saucepan. Cook the mixture over medium-high heat without stirring until it si
caramelized to a rich, reddish brown color. Once it has taken on the correct
color, immediately add the pecans. Stir to combine, and then spread the praline
evenly in the prepared 9-by-9 in [23-by-23-em] baking pan to cool. (You can cool
it on the baking tray if you'd like, but spray the tray with nonstick cooking
spray first.)

5. When cool, remove the praline from the pan and, with a chef's knife, chop it
   into irregular 1⁄4- to 1⁄3-in [6- to 12-mm] pieces. The praline can be made
up to a week ahead and stored in a cool, dry place.

## Blondies
1. In a large bowl, using a whisk, combine the muscovado sugar, melted butter,
   eggs, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is homogeneous and thick.

2. In a separate medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir
   to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the butter and sugar mixture and mix
until homogeneous. Add the cooled chopped praline to the mix- ture. Stir to
combine.

3. Pour the batter into the 9-by-9-in [23-by-23-cm] pan, spread it out with a
   spatula, and bake for 45 minutes, until puffed in the middle and golden brown
and a toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
