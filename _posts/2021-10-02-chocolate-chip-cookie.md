# Ingredients

* 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter*
* 350g flour (75% bread, 25% cake)* 
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 
* 300g dark brown sugar
* 2 large eggs + 1 yolk, at room temperature 
* 3 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 12 ounces semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped with a knife into 1/2- to
  1/4-inch chunks. I used a combination of chips and "discs," w/ discs cut into
  chunks.
* 1 1/4 cup toffee bits*
* Coarse sea salt, for garnish

## Toffee bits

* 1 stick unsalted butter
* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt

# Directions

## Toffee
1. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.

2. Melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sugar and salt and whisk vigorously
for one minute until combined. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture
looks like melted peanut butter and a candy thermometer reaches 295 to 305°F,
about 10 minutes. If the mixture separates at all, remove from heat and whisk
vigorously until recombined. Return to heat and continue cooking.

1. Immediately and carefully pour the hot toffee onto the prepared baking pan,
allowing it to spread into an even layer. Let cool and harden for about 20
minutes.

1. Place the sheet of toffee on a cutting board or in a zip top bag. Use a
mallet, rolling pin, or heavy object to crack it into small pieces.

## Cookies
1. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, gently swirling
pan constantly, until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells
nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until the
butter is a rich brown, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to a medium bowl.  Be
sure to keep the brown bits at the bottom of the pan as well, they hold so much
flavor! 

2. Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. 

3. Cream cooled butter and brown sugar. Add eggs, and vanilla extract. Whisk on
medium-high speed until mixture is pale brownish-yellow and falls off the
whisk in thick ribbons when lifted, about 5 minutes.

4. Gradually add flour mixture and mix on low speed until just barely combined,
with some dry flour still remaining, about 15 seconds. Add chocolate / toffee
and mix on low speed until dough comes together, about 15 seconds longer.
Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate dough **at least overnight**
and up to 3 days. (see note)

5. When ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions
and preheat oven to 350°F. Scoop out 65g-75g balls
onto a lined baking sheet.  Tear each ball in half to reveal a rougher surface,
then stick them back together with the rough sides facing outward. Transfer to
oven and bake 14-17 minutes. Add generous pinch of flaked salt to each cookie. 

6. Remove baking sheets from oven. Let cool for 10 minutes, then transfer
cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.

7. Repeat steps 3 through 5 for remaining cookie dough. Allow cookies to cool
completely before storing in an airtight container, plastic bag, or cookie
jar at room temperature for up to 5 days.

# Notes & tips

1. High quality chocolate chips are really important! I like Guittard if you can
   find them.

2. Brown the butter more than you think! The cookies taste best when
   butter is a rich brown.

3. Letting the cookies rest at least 24 hours results in a much nicer
   texture/bake. My best results so far are freezing for ~1 week before baking.

4. The amount of flour can require some adjustment. If the final dough seems wet
   or sticky, add a bit more flour

5. Adjusting the ratio of bread to cake flour will give you chewier (more
    bread) or cakier (more cake) cookies. Some recent batch thoughts: 250g bread +
    50g wheat had good flavor but cookies were too thin (maybe a baking sode / powder
    error though—based on notes below, this is unlikely)


**Cookies without baking soda**
When baking soda is not included, the cookies will rely on other leavening
methods, like air trapped during the creaming of butter and sugar. 
 Dense texture: The absence of the carbon dioxide reaction means the cookies won't rise
as much, resulting in a denser, heavier texture that is sometimes compared to a
brownie.
 Thicker and taller: Without the rapid spreading caused by baking soda,
the cookies will hold their shape more and bake up thicker and taller.
 Less spread: The cookies will have less spread on the baking sheet, retaining a more
compact form.
 Paler color: The cookies will not brown as easily and will have a
paler, less golden color.
 Different flavor: They may taste blander or have a
less balanced flavor profile since the baking soda isn't there to neutralize the
acidic components.
