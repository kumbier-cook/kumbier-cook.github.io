# Ingredients

* 288g bread flour
* 32g whole wheat flour
* 215g water
* 6g salt
* 48g ripe sourdough starter (see note)

# Directions

1. Add the ingredients to a mixing bowl or stand mixer. Mix until medium
   development (the dough should be smooth, but still a little shaggy, and
elastic. Transfer the dough to a bulk fermentation container and cover.

2. Over the next 1 1/2 hours, perform 3 sets of strech and folds, at 30-minute
   intervals. After each stretch and fold, cover the dough.  

3. After the final round of stretch and folds, place the dough in a bowl and
   cover with airtight wrap. Place in the refigerator overnight. 

4. The next morning, divide doughts into 2 x 290g pieces. Shape the dough into a
   very tight ball with no seam on the bottom. Transfer to a pizza dough tray or
baking sheet and cover.  

5. Proof the dough out on the counter at around 75째F (23째C) for 5-6 hours. When
   fully proofed, the dough will have relaxed outward and be soft to the touch.

6. Preheat your oven with Baking Steel/stone inside, one or two rungs from the
   top, to 550째F (285째C). Shape a dough piece into a large circle on a pizza
peel covered in cornmeal. Top dough with desired toppings (see note). Bake for
7-8 minutes, rotate the pizza in the oven. Bake for another 4-5 minutes until
done to your liking. Repeat for the other piece of dough.

# Notes and tips

1. If you're interested in making a sourdough starter from scratch, see [the
   perfect
load](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/7-easy-steps-making-incredible-sourdough-starter-scratch/)

2. This dough is fairly thin. Adding sauce before baking makes it difficult to
   work with. I prefer a sauceless pizza, with [papi chulo]({% post_url
2021-10-09-papi-chulo-sauce %}) dipping sauce. 

3. My go to cheese blend is part mozsarella, cheddar, parmesean, and asiago.
   Some of my favorite seasonal pizzas are: (i) mushroom, onion, and corn
(summer); (ii) squash, onion, pine nut, basil (fall)
