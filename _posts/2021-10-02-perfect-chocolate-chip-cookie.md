# Ingredients

* 8 ounces unsalted butter
* 1 standard ice cube 5 ounces bread flour
* 5 ounces cake flour 
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 teaspoon table salt
* 5 ounces granulated sugar 
* 3 large egg yolks,  1 large egg white
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 5 ounces dark brown sugar
* 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped with a knife into 1/2- to 1/4-inch chunks
* Coarse sea salt, for garnish

# Directions

1. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, gently swirling
   pan constantly, until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells
nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until the
butter is a rich brown, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to a medium bowl,
whisk in ice cube, transfer to refrigerator, and allow to cool completely, about
20 minutes, whisking occasionally. 


2. Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Place
   granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer
fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium-high speed until mixture is
pale brownish-yellow and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons when lifted, about
5 minutes.

3. Fit paddle attachment onto mixer. When brown butter mixture has cooled (it
   should be just starting to turn opaque again and firm around the edges), add
brown sugar and cooled brown butter to egg mixture in stand mixer. Mix on medium
speed to combine, about 15 seconds. Add flour mixture and mix on low speed until
just barely combined, with some dry flour still remaining, about 15 seconds. Add
chocolate and mix on low speed until dough comes together, about 15 seconds
longer. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate dough **at least
overnight** and up to 3 days.

4. When ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions
   and preheat oven to 350Â°F. Scoop out 60g balls onto a lined baking sheet.
Tear each ball in half to reveal a rougher surface, then stick them back
together with the rough sides facing outward. Transfer to oven and bake 12
minutes. Remove pan from oven and drop on stove/counter (yes, drop!). Replace
pan and continue baking until until golden brown around edges but still soft,
about 2 to 3 minutes. 

5. Remove baking sheets from oven. While cookies are still hot, sprinkle very
   lightly with coarse salt and gently press salt down to embed. Let cool for 10
minutes, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.

6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 for remaining cookie dough. Allow cookies to cool
   completely before storing in an airtight container, plastic bag, or cookie
jar at room temperature for up to 5 days.

# Notes & tips

1. High quality chocolate chips are really important! I like Guittard if you can
   find them.

2. Brown the butter more than you think! I find the cookies taste best when
   butter is a rich brown.

3. Letting the cookies rest at least 24 hours results in a much nicer
   texture/bake.
