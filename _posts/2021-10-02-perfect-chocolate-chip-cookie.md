# Ingredients

* 8 ounces unsalted butter **(best results so far came with strauss butter, not
  sure how much that affects the cookie overall...)**
* 1 standard ice cube 
* 7.5 ounces bread flour
* 2.5 ounces cake flour 
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 teaspoon table salt
* 5 ounces granulated sugar 
* 2 large eggs **(?? Mediumish eggs gave right texture ??)**
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 5 ounces dark brown sugar
* 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped with a knife into 1/2- to
  1/4-inch chunks. I used a combination of chips and "discs," w/ discs cut into
chumnks.
* Coarse sea salt, for garnish

# Directions

1. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, gently swirling
   pan constantly, until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells
nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until the
butter is a rich brown, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to a medium bowl,
whisk in ice cube, transfer to refrigerator, and allow to cool completely, about
20 minutes, whisking occasionally. 


2. Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Place
   granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer
fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium-high speed until mixture is
pale brownish-yellow and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons when lifted, about
5 minutes.

3. Fit paddle attachment onto mixer. When brown butter mixture has cooled (it
   should be just starting to turn opaque again and firm around the edges) 
**(?? just solidified, between "fridge butter" and "soft buter"?? gave right
texture)**, add brown sugar and cooled brown butter to egg mixture in stand mixer. 
Mix on medium
speed to combine, about 15 seconds. Add flour mixture and mix on low speed until
just barely combined, with some dry flour still remaining, about 15 seconds. Add
chocolate and mix on low speed until dough comes together, about 15 seconds
longer. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate dough **at least
overnight** and up to 3 days. (see note)

4. When ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions
   and preheat oven to 325Â°F (convenction bake ideally). Scoop out 65g-75g balls
onto a lined baking sheet.  Tear each ball in half to reveal a rougher surface,
then stick them back together with the rough sides facing outward. Transfer to
oven and bake 10 minutes. Remove pan from oven and drop on stove/counter (yes,
drop!). Add generous pinch of flaked salt to each cookie. Replace pan and continue 
baking until until golden brown around edges but still soft, about 6 to 7 minutes 
**(?? 10 + 6-7 min is for dough coming out of the freezer?? gave right texture).**

5. Remove baking sheets from oven. Drop pan  on stove/counter again. Let cool 
for 10 minutes, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.

6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 for remaining cookie dough. Allow cookies to cool
   completely before storing in an airtight container, plastic bag, or cookie
jar at room temperature for up to 5 days.

# Notes & tips

1. High quality chocolate chips are really important! I like Guittard if you can
   find them.

2. Brown the butter more than you think! I find the cookies taste best when
   butter is a rich brown.

3. Letting the cookies rest at least 24 hours results in a much nicer
   texture/bake. My best results so far are freezing for ~1 week before baking.

4. **(?? butter just solidified, between "fridge butter" and "soft buter"?? gave right
texture)**

# Resources

This recipe is largely adapted from [serious
eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-best-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe).
They have a great discussion/exploration of how different ingredients/techniques
affect the final cookie. I've been modifying it over time to fit my preferred
cookie.
