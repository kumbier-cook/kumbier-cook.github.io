# Ingredients
## For the curry paste
- 1 tsp chilli powder
- 2 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1 3-inch piece ginger (minced)
- 5 cloves garlic (minced)

## Other ingredients
- 4 tbsp coconut oil
- 2 stems curry leaves
- 1 onion (finely sliced)
- 2 sticks cinnamon
- 3 star anise
- 1 lemongrass stalk (bruised at end with rolling pin)
- 4 kaffir lime leaves
- 1 cup masoor dhal (red lentils)
- 1/2 cup chana dhal (split chickpeas)
- 1 13.5 oz can full-fat canned coconut milk
- 1 15.5 oz can diced or crushed tomatoes
- 1 tsp tomato paste
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- cilantro (garnish)

# Instructions
- In a small bowl, combine all the curry paste ingredients until smooth. Set
  aside

- Heat the coconut oil in a wok or large saucepan and when just hot, add the
  curry leaves, cinnamon and star anise. Let them sizzle for 10 seconds before
adding the onion, lemongrass stalk and lime leaves.

- Saut√©e the onions for 4 minutes until softened a little.

- Add the curry paste and stir well. Let this fry gently for 3-4 minutes, reduce
  the heat to low to avoid sticking or burning the paste.

- Stir the two types of lentils and pour in the liquids. Bring to a simmer then
  reduce the heat and lightly simmer (partially covered) for 40-50 minutes,
stirring occasionally to avoid sticking. Cook until the red lentils have broken
down completely. The chana dal should still be visible, but soft and not grainy.

- If they're not cooked after 50 minutes, continue to cook until soft, adding
  more water if needed.
