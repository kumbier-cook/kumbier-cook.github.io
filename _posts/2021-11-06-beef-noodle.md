# Ingredients

* 3 pounds chuck roast, cut into 2 inch cubes
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 4 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil, divided
* 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, washed and thinly sliced
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 4 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* 4 sprigs fresh rosemary
* 1 cup dry red wine
* 4 cup homemade or store-bought beef stock
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 pound pasta noodles (see note)

# Directions

1. Preheat oven to 200Â°F. Season beef all over with salt and pepper. In a dutch
   oven, heat 2 tablespoons oil in each over high heat until lightly smoking.
Divide beef into batches and brown, about 5 minuntes. Transfer to a bowl. 

2. Pour remaining 2 tablespoons oil into the dutch oven and heat until
   shimmering. Add half the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently and scraping
up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until mushrooms have released their
liquid and it has cooked off, about 6 minutes. Add onions garlic, rosemary, and
thyme  and continue cooking, stirring, until mushrooms are browned and onions
are softened and lightly golden, about 7 minutes longer. Season with salt and
pepper.

3. Add the wine and beef stock and bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up any
   browned bits. Add beef and remaining mushrooms to the dutch oven, cover, and
transfer to the oven. Cook until beef is tender (see note), about 3 hours.

4. When beef has about 10 minutes remaining, bring a large pot of heavily salted
   water to a boil. Cook noodles and set aside.

5. Remove beef from the oven. Add cream, bring to a boil, and reduce to a
   simmer. Simmer until lightly reduced and the sauce has thickened slightly.

6. Top noddles with beef/mushroom sauce and serve immediately.

# Notes & tips

1. Fresh pasta makes a big difference in this recipe (see recipe for homemade
   pasta)! I prefer pappardelle or orecchiette noodles.

2. The beef should fall apart easily when ready.
