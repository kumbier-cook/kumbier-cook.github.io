* 2 tablespoons honey
* 2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon fish sauce

### Pineapple salsa

* 1 cup diced pineapple
* 1/4 purple cabbage, thinly sliced
* 1 large carrot, julienned
* small handful of cilantro, roughly chopped
* small handful of mint, roughly chopped
* juice of 1/2 lime
* pinch of salt

# Directions

1. Whisk the pork belly sauce ingredients together. Divide in half and set half
   of it in a container for later. Pour the other half of the marinade into a
ziplock bag then add pork belly, cover and place in the fridge overnight.  

2. The next day, remove pork belly from the marinade (discard marinade) and pay
   dry.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and place
a wire rack on top. Place pork belly fat side up on the wire rack. Put in the
oven to bake for 30 minutes then turn oven down to 225 degrees F and cook for 1
hour. (1 hour per pound of pork belly) Once cooked, remove and let rest for 5-10
minutes before slicing into small bite size pieces.

3. When the pork belly has about 15 minutes left in the oven, prepare the
   pineapple salsa. Add all ingredients in a bowl to combine and set aside.

4. Whisk together the sriracha mayo and set aside.

5. Using the marinade that you placed in a container the night before, pour it
   into a large skillet over medium heat. Bring to boil and let reduce until the
mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 8-10 minutes. Once
thickened, toss pork belly in the sauce.

6. Heat tortillas over an open flame on our stovetop or in a pan, then add pork
   belly, pineapple salsa, and sriracha mayo on top of all of it!
