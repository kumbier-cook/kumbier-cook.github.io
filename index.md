This is a collection of my favorite recipes from friends, family, and across the
internet. Some have been adapted to my own taste over many iterations. Some have
been copied verbatim from the original source. I've tried to reference where
possible and add notes with what I've learned along the way. Each recipe is
constantly evolving. I welcome others to share ideas on tweaks/improvements/new
takes.  

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute a new recipe to the cookbook:

1. Make a copy of the google docs cookbook standard template found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMFtJR32o2LAZx3afjqPX_Xl4hsb2AxFtKNGyjfRYO4/edit?usp=sharing).

2. Edit the doc with instructions for your recipe. Do not change the template
   formatting! 

3. When your recipe is ready, share the google doc link and picture with
   kumbierk@gmail.com.  Please use the subject header: kumbier-cookbook in your
