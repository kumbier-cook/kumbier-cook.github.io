This is a collection of my favorite recipes from friends, family, and the
internet. Some have been adapted to my own taste over many iterations. Some have
been copied verbatim from the original source. I've tried to reference where
possible and add notes with what I've learned along the way. Each recipe is
constantly evolving. I welcome others to share ideas on tweaks/improvements/new
takes.  I hope this becomes a resource for the people I love to share the food
they love. Short of that, I hope you discover delicious new things to try!
